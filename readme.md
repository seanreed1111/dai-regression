## Linear Regression TBD

List the assumptions of linear regression
Define a train/test split and its importance in evaluating models 
Define bias, variance, and irreducible error

Evaluate regression models using the following metrics:

R^2 - And explain why R^2 is not the best measure to use
MSE/RMSE 


Statsmodels:

Students should be able to the following with sklearn and statsmodels:
Perform a test/train split on data 
Build a linear regression model with both continuing and categorical features
Evaluate a model using R-squared and RMSE




## Logistic Regression
Define classification and regression 
Describe the difference between using Logistic Regression and Linear Regression

Explain and perform Logistic Regression for classification
Describe the difference between using Logistic Regression and Linear Regression
Interpret beta coefficients in logistic regression
Classification Metrics
Accuracy
Precision
Recall
Confusion matrix

Statsmodels:

Students should be able to the following with sklearn and statsmodels:
Perform a test/train split on data 
Build a linear regression and, logistic regression model
Evaluate a model using metrics outlined in modelling standards
